# Project Name: Automated Crawling, Categorization and Sentiment Analysis of Digital News with Incorporated Feedback System. 

## Problem Statement- 1329
The project addresses the need for a 360-degree feedback software for monitoring Government of India-related news stories in regional media using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

## Solution Proposed
We created a smart system capable of automatically scraping news from various websites, specifically looking for news stories related to the Government of India. The system sorts these stories into categories and assesses their sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. In the event of negative news, alerts are sent to the respective government department. This system keeps the government updated with news events, allowing for quick responses when necessary.

## What We've Created
Our product is a user-friendly platform featuring a single-click solution. It includes a web crawler to fetch the latest news, machine learning models for article categorization and sentiment analysis, and a curated news feed with positivity scores and source information. It also sends email alerts for negative news to the concerned department.

## Tech Stack Used
- **AI**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and BERT libraries for creating ML models.

- **Server**: Django backend.
- **Frontend**: Next.js and Tailwind CSS frontend.
